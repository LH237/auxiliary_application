Hi, I just ran into an issue, maybe you can help me fix it...
In the python code (https://github.com/LH237/auxiliary_application/blob/main/Code.py), I want to run the function "create_basic_project" in the class "functions".
It should run, when you enter the command "basis projekt erstellen" in the command prompt window, but it won't!
The commands are defined in the "start" function. I hope you can help me.

PS: The text in most of the strings is german...
